<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO OLIVIA</h1>

<h2>My fave movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Hunter killer</h3>

<p>It always feels like I'm watching this movie for the first time. If you love submarines, this is definitely one for you.</p>

<h3>pretty woman</h3>

<p>I don't know what it is about thisone but it was my earliest introduction to a woman taking ownership of her identity outside of what anyone thought of her and it has stayed with me since then.</p>
<h3>June</h3>
<p>Somewhat of a comfort even if it's just parts of it.</p>
